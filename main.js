// ğŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!
// write a function that tells you your heart rate training zone, so you know what your gains are when you're squatting every morning
// your maximum heart rate is your age in years minused from 220
// your 'heart rate reserve' is max heart rate minus your average resting heart rate 
// if HR during squats is between 0 -50 % of 'heart rate reserve' this zone is not exercise
// if HR during squats is between 50 -75 % of 'heart rate reserve'this is the fat burn zone
// if HR during squats is between 75 -85 % of 'heart rate reserve' this is the aerobic endurance zone
// if HR during squats is above 85 % of 'heart rate reserve' this is the anaerobic threshold zone

// 

//ğŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
